Okay, so you wake up in a weird spot, right? No clue who you are or why you're even there. Well, welcome to Neo-Terra!

Your main job? Stay alive! You gotta make your way through ten tough levels, going through all kinds of places. Think green fields, fiery volcanoes, and creepy forests.

Watch out, since there are some nasty monsters lurking. Time to fight! Beat them, and they'll drop some loot, like magic swords or tough armor, to make you stronger.

And you're going to need that strength since a Big Boss is waiting on the last level. People say he's the cruelest character around.

So, feeling up to the challenge? Grab your sword and let's go! Your story begins now in Neo-Terra.
